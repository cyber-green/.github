# Welcome to Cyber-Green

Cyber-Green is a collection of projects focused on creating and maintaining efficient, modern, and powerful development environments. We specialize in developer tooling and configurations designed to enhance productivity and streamline workflows.

Our goal is to provide well-documented, high-quality configurations and tools for developers and power users who value speed and control in their computing environment.

## Our Projects

Here are some of our key projects:

*   **[cg-i3dotfiles](https://github.com/cyber-green/cg-i3dotfiles)**: A complete and modern Linux desktop setup featuring the i3 window manager, Polybar, and a suite of other tools tailored for a productive development experience.
*   **[cg-nvim](https://github.com/cyber-green/cg-nvim)**: A fast, feature-rich, and highly customized Neovim configuration. It is optimized for performance and comes with a curated set of plugins managed by vim-plug.

We are continuously working on improving these projects and exploring new ideas.
